A personal Discord bot project. 

Currently refactoring and rewriting a javascript code to have better structure. Furthermore porting the website to Vue.js

The ultimate goal is to have a completely 'dynamic' bot with support for lots of servers. Users would then be able to administer the bot on its website with control over commands, greetings, messages etc.
